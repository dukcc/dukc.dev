Is this your first time trying to compile a React Typescript library, so you can publish it on npm? This was my first time, I found it to be very complicated, so I wanted to document my experience.

For this article, we're gonna assume you have a React + Vite Storybook project with Tailwind React components, that you're using Typescript, and that your directory structure looks like this:
```
/
└── /src
    ├── /components
    │   ├── /Button
    │   │   ├── /Button.tsx
    │   │   ├── /Button.stories.tsx
    │   │   └── /index.ts
    │   └── /index.ts
    └── index.ts
```

### Choosing a Compiler

There are many Javascript compilers out there, and finding one that handles our stack was tricky for me. I eventually found [tsup](https://github.com/egoist/tsup), which is powered by [esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild). Install as a dev dependancy it with:

```bash
pnpm add tsup -D
```

Now we have it installed! Let's add a `build` script to `package.json`:
```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "tsup"
}
```

And now let's create a tsup configuration file, named `tsup.config.ts`:
```ts
import { defineConfig } from "tsup";

export default defineConfig({
  entry: ["src/index.ts", "src/index.css"],
  outDir: "dist",
  splitting: true,
  treeshake: true,
  sourcemap: true,
  clean: true,
  dts: { resolve: true },
  format: ["cjs", "esm"],
  skipNodeModulesBundle: true,
  target: "es2020",
});
```
What this will do is compile your `src/index.ts` file, and all the exported files from `index.ts`, into the `dist` directory.

It will compile into Common JS and ESM formats, and generate types for you, which are the `d.ts` files.

Notice that we also have it to compile index.css, which is our main tailwind file containing `@tailwind core`, etc. This will compile all the tailwind classes that your project uses into normal css. Replace the filename if yours is different.

### Setting up Tailwind

If you want others to have the Tailwind config you used for your components, you should make a [preset](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/presets).

Make a file in `src` called `tailwind-core.ts`, with your theme and other things your Tailwind config depends on:

```ts
// Example preset
export const tailwindCore = {
  theme: {
    colors: {
      r: "#ff0000",
      g: "#00ff00",
      b: "#0000ff",
    }
  },
};
```
Then in your main `index.ts` file, export `tailwindCore`:
```ts
export * from "./components";
export { tailwindCore } from "./tailwind-core";
```

Then you can also use this preset with the Storybook project you're currently in, this is how others will use it, but they will have a different import directory.

```ts
// tailwind.config.js
import { tailwindCore } from "./src/tailwind-core";

/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  content: ["./src/**/*.{ts,tsx}"],
  presets: [tailwindCore],
};
```

### Compiling and Testing

Now you should be able to run `pnpm build`, and all your code will compile into the `dist` directory!

```
/
└── /dist
    ├── index.d.ts
    ├── index.d.cts
    ├── index.css
    ├── index.css.map
    ├── index.js.map
    ├── index.js
    ├── index.cjs.map
    └── index.cjs
```

Now, in `package.json`, add where your compiled code will live, for all versions of JS:
```json
{
  "name": "@dukc/test-component-library",
  "description": "A React component and Tailwind style library for this article.",
  "main": "./dist/index.cjs",
  "module": "./dist/index.js",
  "types": "./dist/index.d.ts",
  "type": "module",
}
```
Now let's test our project locally, to make sure it works before publishing. First, copy the directory path of where your component library lives. Then create a new React project somewhere else, we'll use Next.js as an example, make sure yours uses Tailwind.
```bash
pnpm dlx create-next-app@latest
```

Then in that new test project, link to your component library, using npm link (replace directory with yours):
```bash
pnpm link /home/dukc/Documents/GitHub/test-component-library/
```

Then you should be able to import stuff from your component library, with the name of your package. Let's try to import our Tailwind preset:
```ts
// tailwind.config.ts
import type { Config } from "tailwindcss";
import { tailwindCore } from "@dukc/test-component-library";

const config: Config = {
  content: [
    "./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
    "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
    "./app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
  ],
  presets: [tailwindCore],
};
export default config;

```

And now you should be able to use your Tailwind styles in your test app. Let's try to import our button now (also import the compiled css):
```tsx
// page.tsx
import { Button } from "@dukc/test-component-library";
import "@dukc/test-component-library/dist/index.css";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div className="bg-r flex items-center justify-center">
      <Button>Hello World</Button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
And it should work!

### Publish your Library

You've built your project, set up `package.json`, tested it with `pnpm link`, and it works. Now, let's do the last steps.

Create an `.npmignore` file inside your component library, which will ignore everything that isn't your compiled code in your component library:
```
public
src
.vscode
.storybook
index.html
.gitignore
.eslintrc.cjs
pnpm-lock.yaml
postcss.config.js
tailwind.config.js
tsconfig.app.json
tsconfig.json
tsconfig.node.json
tsup.config.ts
vite.config.ts
node_modules
```
Make sure to add any other files/directories that you have, that you don't want included in your package.

Then, finish up your `package.json`, such as adding the link to your repo, keywords, your license, and the version.

And make sure to add react as a peerDependancy, and remove any other dependency that is used for development that is under `dependencies`:
```json
{
  "repository": "https://some-git-provider.com/test-component-library",
  "keywords": [
    "react",
    "ui-kit",
    "library",
    "tailwind"
  ],
  "main": "./dist/index.cjs",
  "module": "./dist/index.js",
  "types": "./dist/index.d.ts",
  "private": false,
  "author": "dukc",
  "license": "GPL-3.0",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "type": "module",
  "dependencies": { // Only the dependencies the project uses
    "@radix-ui/react-checkbox": "^1.1.1",
    "class-variance-authority": "^0.7.0"
  },
  "peerDependencies": {
    "react": "^18.3.1"
  },
}
```

Then test your package one last time, using `pnpm pack`. This will package your library, the same way that `pnpm publish` will. Look inside your packaged library, to see if the files are correct.

Then create an npm account [here](https://www.npmjs.com), and login to it inside your terminal using `pnpm login`. If you have an organization [scoped package name](https://docs.npmjs.com/configuring-your-npm-client-with-your-organization-settings), you'll need to configure it: `npm config set scope <org-name>`.

Then you should be able to publish!
```bash
pnpm publish
```

Congrats!
