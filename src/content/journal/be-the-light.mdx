![Poster](/journal/be-the-light/1.png)

> (Matthew 5:14-16 CSB) 14 You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden. 15 Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. 16 In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.


Created for the Concept Central poster contest, July 2024. Couldn't submit it because of a Discord error if someone from that server reads this. Made with Blender.

Also made another poster before this one, which is titled "User Interface".
