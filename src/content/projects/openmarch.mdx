**Project info** - OpenMarch is a free open source drill writing software built on web app frameworks. It will be released as cross platform desktop app for drill writers, band directors, and students alike.

This is one of the first project I've contributed to, it started off where I just found the website while searching for something. And it looked cool, and the creator uses all the technologies I use. I wanted to contribute, so I emailed him, and we made some mockups. I took a break then got back in touch, and I redid the front-end for him!

If you're interested in marching band, drum corp, or just any type of drill writing, please checkout this app, and give us feedback [here](https://openmarch.com).

For the design, I wanted to do something modern, but because it's a creation app, it has to be concise, compact, and easy to use. I ended up with kind of a glassmorphic style, very subtle though. I reimplemented the modals as panels that attach to the sidebar, and overall designed a whole new aethstetic for the app. I also designed him a website, which will be done soon.
