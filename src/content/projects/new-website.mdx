A brand new website. After making many prototypes, I landed on this design. I really wanted to make something brutalist, harsh, and something with cool animations. I first went with minimalist brutatism, then neobrutalism, then I just decided to go fully brutalist and harsh with bright RGB colours. You're welcome.
