# Tsunami Websites

I created 2 websites for Tsunami Network. One for their Minecraft hosting network, and one for their pterodactyl egg software. This project was one of my first clients, and I was pretty new to design and web development at the time. I'm pretty happy with the results.

I love the look of the Extronode website. I used one of their brand colours for the background, and this was one of my first times using glassmorphic cards in design.

And with the MutliEgg website, I used simple shapes in the background, with a pink background (what the client requested). Then organized the content in simple grids.
