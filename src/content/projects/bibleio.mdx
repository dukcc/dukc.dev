**Project info** - Bibleio is my biggest project yet, and the one I'm most focused on. Bibleio is innovating the industry of Bible technology, by focusing on design, and modern features and frameworks. We are 100% free & open-source, we use Rust for our backends, and we love design. Learn more [here](https://bibleio.com).

For the design, I'm kind of in my brutalist and minimal era, so I wanted to go for neobrutalism. The background is gray, and the borders are black. There are simple, minimal colours, and we love to use shapes to define us, and for some colour. The goal for this design is to be easy, and simple, and soon we plan to make it more accessible. We want to include microinteractions, and make this not feel like a generic minimalist app. We still want this to be unique.

For the development, this was the first full UI kit I've finished. I documented the design and designed the base components, and made styles all in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1398417551065522372/bibleio-design-kit), then coded it all in React, and published my first [npm package](https://npmjs.com/@bibleio/design)! See the GitHub [here](https://github.com/bibleio/design). See how I built a React, Typescript, Tailwind component library on my first [blog post](/journal/compiling-a-react-component-library).
