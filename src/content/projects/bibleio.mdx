**Project info** - Bibleio is my biggest project yet, and the one I'm most focused on. The Bible software industry is full of copyright, non-private, non-modern, paid software. We want to change that. Learn more [here](https://bibleio.com).

For the design, I wanted to go for something kind of brutalist, and minimal. After playing around for a lot, I decided to incorporate small shadows to add depth to components, and the shapes we use to add color now glow. We try to include microinteractions and subtle animations to make it feel more alive.

For the development, this was the first full UI kit I've finished. I documented the design and designed the base components, and made styles all in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1398417551065522372/bibleio-design-kit), then coded it all in React, and published my first [npm package](https://npmjs.com/@bibleio/design)! See the GitHub [here](https://github.com/bibleio/design). See how I built a React, Typescript, Tailwind component library on my first [blog post](/journal/compiling-a-react-component-library).
